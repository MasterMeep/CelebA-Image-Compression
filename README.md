# CelebA-Image-Compression
this is an Auto-Encoder model made to compress a resized CelebA image from 64 x 64 into a 16 x 16, and also uncompress back into the 64 x 64. the outputs of this model are still quite lossy as it was trained on only 4 epochs due to hardware + time limitations. the model would have improved significantly if more epochs were included.
